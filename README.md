Neural network in javascript

Work in progress.

* Initially a simple neural network implementation( with quadratic cost function,sigmoid activation and stochastic gradient descent).
* Will update further for preventing overfitting(L1,L2 regularisation) , more cost functions(log likelihood, cross entropy etc.),    
  activation functions(softmax).
* Other machine learning algorithms like SVM.
