Neural network in javascript

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/AbT10/Jbrain/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/AbT10/Jbrain)

Work in progress.

* Initially a simple neural network implementation( with quadratic cost function,sigmoid activation and stochastic gradient descent).
* Will update further for preventing overfitting(L1,L2 regularisation) , more cost functions(log likelihood, cross entropy etc.),    
  activation functions(softmax).
* Other machine learning algorithms like SVM.
